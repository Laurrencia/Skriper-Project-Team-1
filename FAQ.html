</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary> I received an email with a temporary password to access, but I did not request it, what should I do?
</summary>
<p> No need to worry, your account is safe. If you didn't request the access code, don't worry, you may simply omit the email and that would be it. This can happen because someone entered a wrong email or tried to access your account, but as long as you do not share the code that you received, your account is safe.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> After deleting my account, can I get my codes back?</summary>
<p> No, if the deletion process has already been executed, you will no longer be able to recover your codes.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Can I cancel the request to delete my account?</summary>
<p> Yes, as long as the process has not been executed. At any time you can access your profile and in the account deletion tab you can cancel the application process.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary> What licenses do the published codes have in skriper.dev?</summary>
<p> When you publish code to skriper.dev it is then licensed under the MIT license. If your code is private we do not give it any license and you can license it as you may please, we recommend that you include the type of license as a comment in your code. Remember that when publishing a code in creeper.dev publicly other users can “fork” your code, skriper.dev keeps as a reference the original code from where the fork was made as an attribution of the respective credits.</p>
</details>

<p> These are ranges that allow accounts to be identified. These ranges are obtained by fulfilling some parameters that are described in your profile page.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> What do I do if my code is copied?</summary>
<p> Copying a code is performing a "copy & paste" and not a fork, the fork maintains the respective relationship with the code from which it was copied, but if you consider that the code was copied, you can send us a review request to our email. If you want to disable the fork option in your code, just go to settings in the editor and disable the fork option.</p>
